Kinematics: The specifications of the robot, how many wheels, how many motors, degrees of freedom, etc.

Diferential wheels
Always introduce referentials of the robot, the "world" and of the sensors.

UKF vs EKF vs Particle Filters

For Linear Robots KF (Kalman Filter) Is the Optimal Solution.

EKF represents anything that is stochastic (non-linear) by an average . Linearize the system and performs Kalman Filter on non-linear problems


UKF Computationally heavier, better results. 
Use multiple points to perform the estimations.
