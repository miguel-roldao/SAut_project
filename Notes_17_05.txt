Kinematics: The specifications of the robot, how many wheels, how many motors, degrees of freedom, etc.

Diferential wheels
Always introduce referentials of the robot, the "world" and of the sensors.

UKF vs EKF vs Particle Filters

For Linear Robots KF (Kalman Filter) Is the Optimal Solution.

EKF represents anything that is stochastic (non-linear) by an average . Linearize the system and performs Kalman Filter on non-linear problems


UKF Computationally heavier, better results. 
Use multiple points to perform the estimations.

-------------------

Status Error

"No transform from...."

You need to perform a transformation between the frames of the sensors/robot and the "world"? 

---------------

Distribute the work between the elements of the group!!

Aruco markers.

8 markers, 2 per corner (2 orientations) ??? Probably 8 is not enough, and put them in the corners is possibly not the best choice??

Cameras are cheaper

-----------------

AMCL (Adaptative Monte Carlo) vs Regular MCL

The AMCL reduce number of particles so that it is computationally lighter.
